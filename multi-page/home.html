        <p>
            Now that corporations are back on campus, they are looking for two things 
            that were not available in the corporate campuses of the past. 
            One is a new idea, the other is an older one.

            The new idea involves integrating new technologies with new workplace strategies. 
            A new work setting provides the opportunity for a fresh start with office designs 
            that help them accelerate the integration of technology. 
            The older idea is quite simple. Recall the feeling you had while walking across 
            your college campus quad — the knowledge that you stood in a historic place defined 
            by the legacy of those who came before you and the sense of optimism about 
            the future because of what you could contribute. 
            That spirit and sense of belonging are the emerging ideas behind new campuses.

                Libraries can house technical books, editorial reference guides, material samples, or
